            <h3>How can you prevent cyberattacks? </h3>
            <p>Set up multifactor authentication (MFA) 
                MFA is a way to secure your account by requiring a second form of identification. It can help prevent the negative consequences of bad user habits such as setting weak passwords, reusing the same password on different sites, and other things such as falling for phishing scams, etc. Even if your password has been compromised due to these circumstances, 2FA acts as another line of defense and gives you time to reset your passwords and secure your account again.

            <h3>VPN</h3>
            <p>A VPN service is essential to encrypt your internet traffic for better security. As an added plus, good ones can block ads, prevent tracking cookies, and bypass geo-restrictions by changing your device’s location. VPNs should be used especially when you are on a public network in order to mask your IP address so your online actions are virtually untraceable. Unless you are on a private network that requires a password, the data transmitted during your online session can be vulnerable. VPN will make it safe for you to pay bills, do your online shopping, send emails, and more from anywhere. </p>

            <p>Keep in mind, just like all the other tools, a VPN isn’t a magical cure-all to all your cybersecurity problems. They are still suseptible to malware and online attacks, so VPNs should be used with other tools. </p>
